A little personal health & fitness tracker.

## Status

Still sketching ideas. Still looking up almost _every_ bit of Go syntax.

## Goals

- Learn Golang
- Experiment with single-binary applications
- Experiment with building a CLI app
- Keep control of my data

## Running

Define a `STRAVA_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.
